# Hooligan

Vandalizing Vending Machines has a chance to make them drop either a small amount of their inventory, junk, eddies or break them. Vandalizing Drop Points has a chance to give a small amount of eddies or break them. Divided into four files to customize your experience. Works with slaughtomatic vending machines as well.

Can hit them with everything (weapons, fists, mantis etc).

Broken Vending Machines can no longer be used or vandalized until they are fixed.

Same as HooliganVendingMachines but will drop an item/eddies/junk/nothing on breaking down instead of getting an item/eddies/junk/nothing on every hit.
